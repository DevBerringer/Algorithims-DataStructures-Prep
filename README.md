## Contributing

1. Place your solution in the appropriate folder based on problem type and difficulty.
2. Follow Clean Code principles for clarity and readability.
3. Ensure filenames are clear, for example: `TwoSum.java` or `LongestSubstring.java`.
4. Class level Java Docs will be used for explanations 


## Exmaple
```java
/**
* Solution for the LeetCode problem: Two Sum.
*
* This class provides an efficient solution to the problem where given an array of integers and a target,
* we need to find two indices such that the numbers at those indices add up to the target.
*
* Approach:
* - Use a HashMap to store the complement (target - current number) and the index of the current number.
* - Traverse the array once, checking if the complement exists in the HashMap. If it does, return the indices.
* - Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array.
